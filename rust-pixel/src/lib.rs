//! RustPixel is a rust 2d mini-game engine.
//! It is ideal for fast prototyping of 2d pixel style games
//! it is also a perfect choice for developing and debugging CPU-heavy game core algorithms
//! You can compile your core algorithms to ffi or wasm libs, and used by other gaming
//! frontend or backend
//!
//! It supports two rendering mode: text mode and graphical mode.
//! Text mode runs in a terminal.
//! Graphical mode supports SDL running in a OS window or wasm on a webpage.
//!
//! In RustPixel, game scenes are rendered using individual Cell and managed by Buffer
//!
//! Various modules asset, audio, event, game, log, render, algorithm, util are offered to ease
//! game development
//!
//! We also provide a base mode in which only algorithm, event and util modules are compiled.
//! Base mode requires fewer dependencies and therefore it is a good fit for compiling to ffi
//! or wasm libs.
